This project is for an assignment I'm doing with TTS (Tech Talent South) Full Immersion Foundational Java Course. With this assignment, I will be creating a mock website with Spring Boot. The Theme of my website is interior design. The website will have a contact form that is connected to a database. Any input from the user such as an email address, name, or subject matter will be shown in the database and displayed on an html page called result.html. In addition, there will be a blog page where users can submit a blog post if desired.
